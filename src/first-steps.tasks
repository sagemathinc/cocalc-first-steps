In project settings (\"Settings and configuration\"), find \"Add People to Project\" at upper right. You can search and select an existing user or invite a new user by email.\n\n- [ ] Look in _project settings_ for the section 'Project usage and quotas' and see whether your project has Internet access.\n\n<div align='right'>**4 tasks left**</div>","position":0.26873779296875,"last_edited":1510502960851,"task_id":"3d4b3385-3927-4263-a7f2-f3b7585a5b66"}

This allows you to edit the same files, run the same computations, and do all of it from the exact same place (and even at the same time).\n\nBeing in the cloud means each of your projects is available on the internet which you can access any time, from any modern browser, on any computer.\n\n- Got a new device? Just slap on your favorite browser and log right in. No installs necessary.\n- Want to share some data analysis you wrote in Python or R?
