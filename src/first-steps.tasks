You'll see this \"first-steps.tasks\" file and a bunch of additional documents. Come back here by clicking on \"first-steps.tasks\" again or select the tab for this opened file.\n\n- [ ] Click the wrench icon to open the tab for the _project settings_.\n  It allows you to set some basic configuration of the project,\n  control how upgrades from subscriptions are applied,\n  and gives you additional status information.\n\n- [ ] You can share your projects with _collaborators_ by viewing and editing your files together. In project settings (\"Settings and configuration\"), find \"Add People to Project\" at upper right. You can search and select an existing user or invite a new user by email.\n\n- [ ] Look in _project settings_ for the section 'Project usage and quotas' and see whether your project has Internet access.\n\n<div align='right'>**3 tasks left**</div>","position":0.26873779296875,"last_edited":1510664416894,"task_id":"3d4b3385-3927-4263-a7f2-f3b7585a5b66"}

{"desc":"## CoCalc is a platform for Collaborative Calculation in the Cloud.\n\nBut what does that mean?\n\nCollaboration means sharing the same environment with anyone by adding them to a project. This allows you to edit the same files, run the same computations, and do all of it from the exact same place (and even at the same time).\n\nBeing in the cloud means each of your projects is available on the internet which you can access any time, from any modern browser, on any computer.\n\n- Got a new device? Just slap on your favorite browser and log right in. No installs necessary.\n\n- Want to share some data analysis you wrote in Python or R? Don't worry about your friend having the right environment, just invite them to the project or share a public link with them.\n\n### File Creation\n\nBack to the tutorial, let's start with something simple:\n- [ ] Create a file named `hello_world.md`\n\nThere are a few ways to do this.
