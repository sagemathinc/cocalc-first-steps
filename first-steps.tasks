Click there now to see the available tabs.\nThey control aspects of the UI and various configuration options,\nand allow you to [subscribe](https://cocalc.com/policies/pricing.html) to the service.\n\n  - [ ] Click \"Preferences\" to see settings for your name, email address, editor settings, and so on.\n\n  - [ ] Click on the other tabs, \"Subscriptions\", \"Upgrades\", and so on for a first view of what they contain.\n\n- [ ] Just right of account settings, the _About_ tab gives you more information about what CoCalc is, and the _network status_ dialog helps you to debug connection issues. Click \"About\" to see what's there.\n\n## The Second Row\nProject specific interface\n\nEach such project is a collection of files, like on a local computer, which are organized through the \"Files\" tab.\nThe idea is to create a project for each task -- or \"project\" -- you work on.\n\n- [ ] After clicking \"Projects\", click on one of the projects listed. Note the row of buttons with \"Files\" at the upper left.\n\n- [ ] Click the wrench icon to open the tab for the _project settings_.\nIt allows you to set some basic configuration of the project,\ncontrol how upgrades from subscriptions are applied,\nand give you control and status information.\n\n- [ ] Look in _project settings_ for the section 'Project usage and quotas' and see whether your project has Internet access.\n\n- [ ] You can share your projects with _collaborators_ by viewing and editing your files together. In project settings (\"Settings and configuration\"), find \"Add People to Project\" at upper right. You can search and select an existing user or invite a new user by email.\n","position":0.26873779296875,"last_edited":1509981488899,"task_id":"3d4b3385-3927-4263-a7f2-f3b7585a5b66"}
