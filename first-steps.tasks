This allows you to edit the same files, run the same computations, and do all of it from the exact same place (and even at the same time).<br/>\nBeing in the cloud means each of your projects is available on the internet which you can access any time, from any modern browser, on any computer. \n\n- Got a new device? Just slap on your favorite browser and log right in. No installs necessary.\n- Want to share some data analysis you wrote in Python or R?
